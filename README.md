# AI Operations Assistant  
### GenAI Intern Assignment

An AI-powered operations assistant built using a **multi-agent GenAI architecture**.  
The system plans tasks using an LLM, executes real-world API calls, and verifies responses before returning structured outputs.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Run Locally on Localhost)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd ai_ops_assistant
2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Windows

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Mac / Linux

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file from the template:

cp .env.example .env
Add your API keys inside the .env file.

5. Run the Project
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser at:

http://localhost:8501
🔐 Environment Variables (.env.example)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
🧠 Architecture Overview
The system follows a multi-agent architecture consisting of three core agents and a modular tools layer.

🗂 Planner Agent
Accepts natural language input from the user

Uses Gemini LLM to generate a structured JSON execution plan

Determines:

Required tools

Step sequence

Input parameters

⚙️ Executor Agent
Executes the plan generated by the Planner

Calls real third-party APIs via tool modules

Normalizes tool inputs to handle LLM variability

Collects raw API responses

✅ Verifier Agent
Validates executor outputs using the LLM

Ensures correctness and completeness

Formats the final structured response

Handles partial or inconsistent results

🔌 Tools Layer
Each external API is wrapped inside a dedicated tool module to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

🌐 Integrated APIs
1. GitHub REST API
Used to:

Search repositories

Fetch repository metadata

Retrieve star counts and descriptions

2. OpenWeatherMap API
Used to:

Fetch real-time weather data

Retrieve temperature and weather conditions by city

🧪 Example Prompts

⚠️ Known Limitations / Tradeoffs
Sequential Tool Execution
API calls are executed step-by-step to maintain deterministic execution flow.

No API Response Caching
Repeated requests may result in redundant API calls, increasing latency and cost.

LLM Output Variability
Despite JSON sanitization and input normalization, occasional retries may be required.

Basic UI
Built with Streamlit for rapid prototyping rather than production-grade UI.

Limited Tool Set
Currently supports only GitHub and Weather APIs.

🔮 Future Improvements
Parallel tool execution

Response caching layer

Cost and latency tracking

Advanced retry strategies

Web-based dashboard UI

Tool registry system for scalable integrations
